To Do App for CSC690 @ SFSU

How to use:
- Upon opening you will be presented with a list. If you have not used this app before, it will be blank. If you have used it before, it will contain all of the tasks you previously added to it.
- To ADD a task, click the "+" symbol in the upper right corner. This will take you to a screen where you can provide a name for your new task. Once you have named your task, hit the "Add" button and you will be taken back to the task list, where your new task will appear.
- To EDIT a task that has already been created, simply click on its name, and you will be taken to an edit screen that will provide you an input area for what you would like to rename the selected task to. Once you have entered the new name, click "Make Changes" and you will be taken back to the list where you find your edited task.
- To DELETE a task, swipe the task to the left and a red "Delete" button will appear. If you tap this button, your task will be removed for the list.
- To MARK A TASK as complete or incomplete, tap the checkbox next to the name of the task. Tapping this box will change the status from unchecked to checked and vice versa.
